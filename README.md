# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of the Edunet Foundation Internship Program in collaboration with IBM SkillsBuild. The goal is to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K per year based on various attributes from the U.S. Census dataset.

The model is deployed using *Streamlit* for an interactive user interface.


## 🚀 Project Overview

- *Objective*: Classify income category (<=50K or >50K)
- *Model Used*: Gradient Boosting Classifier
- *Dataset*: Adult Census Income dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- *Output*: Real-time salary prediction based on user input
- *Platform*: Streamlit (link below)
